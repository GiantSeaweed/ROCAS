1. Full version of paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07774

2. Execution videos for accident cases: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLagazsxgy9BD2SdAO66ZR-rmfimeWpsgF

- For each accident case, we provide three videos:
  - **I: Original accident**: the original accident video.
  - **II: Physical Mutated (No accident)**: the video of the similar scenario with the physical mutation applied to the environment / other objects. The ego vehicle does not cause an accident in this video.
  - **III: Cyber Mutated (No accident)**: the video of the similar scenario with the cyber mutation applied to the ego AD vehicle. The ego vehicle does not cause an accident in this video.
